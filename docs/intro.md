Let's get started! Here's what you should read first before using Vecty:

-	[DOM Operations: the lowest level](dom_operations.md)
-	[Components: a composition of DOM operations](components.md)
-	[Rendering](rendering.md)
-	[Safety and Unsafety](safety_and_unsafety.md)
-	[Diff Algorithm](diff_algorithm.md)
-	[Known Issues](known_issues.md)
